the Problem:

The automotive market faces challenges in determining fair selling prices for cars. Buyers and sellers often struggle to assess whether they are making informed decisions regarding pricing.
Define the Objective:

The goal of this project is to create a predictive model that estimates car prices based on various features such as mileage, engine capacity, maximum power, and more.

Gather Data:
A dataset named Car details.csv is collected, which contains information about different cars, including their specifications and selling prices.
Load the Data:

The dataset is loaded into the project using the Pandas library, which allows for easy manipulation and analysis of the data.

Explore the Data:
Initial exploration of the dataset is performed to understand its structure, including the number of rows and columns, and to view the first few entries.
Clean the Data:

Missing values are identified and removed to ensure the dataset is complete and reliable for analysis. This step is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the predictive model.

Feature Extraction:
New features are created from existing columns to enhance the dataset:
Torque: Extracted and converted to RPM.
Mileage: Converted to kilometers per liter (kmpl).
Engine Capacity: Extracted from the 'engine' column.
Maximum Power: Extracted from the 'max_power' column.
Transform the Data:

Unnecessary columns are dropped to simplify the dataset. Categorical variables (like transmission type and fuel type) are encoded into numerical values to make them suitable for machine learning algorithms.

Visualize the Data:
Data visualization techniques, such as heatmaps, are used to identify correlations between different features and the target variable (selling price). This helps in understanding the relationships within the data.

Prepare for Modeling:
The dataset is split into training and testing sets. This allows for the evaluation of the model's performance on unseen data.
Train the Model:

Two machine learning models are implemented:

Random Forest Regressor: A robust model that is trained on the dataset.
Linear Regression: A simpler model for comparison.

Evaluate the Model:
The accuracy of both models is calculated and compared. This step helps in determining which model performs better in predicting car prices.
Implement Solutions:

Based on the model's performance, the project can lead to the development of tools or applications that help users estimate car prices, providing valuable insights for buyers and sellers.
